== Introduction ==

itTalent is a general usage datbase manager for manager IT/RD talent 
information. It works like any talent information system but it
was designed in a small scale and focus on talent's real experience only.

I hope this could be used standalone in android pad or android phone and
also in traditional web.

    	=== license ===
	I haven't decide the license model yet. Since this is nothing but
	a specific headhunter's application it might not be very popular.
	Currently, itTalent is hosted in github, therefore, feel free to
	download and use. We will not ask for pay the usage.


== Design ==

* Leverage stable open source tool as much as possible to reduce reinventing the wheel.
* mybatis and the generator tool for reduce the work on data access.
* jquery and jquery-ui for simple web UI

== GWT ==
* consider to host in google 

== Merge database ==
